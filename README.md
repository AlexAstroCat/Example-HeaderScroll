# Stretchable/Scrollable Table Header example

This example project demonstrates how to use UIKit's built-in features of scroll and table views to implement a stretchable header view for a table.  The source is available in both Swift and Objective-C.

This is the companion code to (an article I wrote on this topic)[https://nachbaur.com/2020/05/06/stretchable-tableview-header/], which you should go check out!
